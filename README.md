# Handling Missing Values in Pandas 🧹📊

This repository demonstrates essential techniques to handle missing values using Python's Pandas library. It is part of my data analytics learning journey and was completed on Google Colab.

## 📌 What This Project Covers

Handling missing data is a crucial step in data preprocessing. In this notebook, I have explored:

- ✅ Identifying missing values
- 🧼 Dropping rows with missing values using `dropna()`
- 🔢 Replacing missing values (Imputation) using:
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Mode

## 📂 Tools Used

- Google Colab
- Python
- Pandas

---

## 📁 Dataset Used

The analysis was done on a sample dataset named `placement.csv`, which contains placement-related features and some missing values for demonstration. 


## 📖 What I Learned

- How to use `isnull()` and `sum()` to detect missing data
- When to use **dropping** vs **imputation**
- How **mean**, **median**, and **mode** affect data differently
- Importance of choosing the right imputation strategy based on data distribution

## 🎥 Tutorial Credit

The concepts and techniques followed in this notebook were learned from a YouTube tutorial from the channel [**Siddhardhan**]. I thank the creator for the clear explanations that helped me understand missing data handling effectively.

## 📈 Future Updates

This is a part of my ongoing learning. In future commits, I may add:
- Handling missing categorical values
- Visualization of missing data (using seaborn/missingno)
- Advanced imputation (KNN, interpolation, etc.)
